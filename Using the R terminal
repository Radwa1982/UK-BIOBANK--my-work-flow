#### theses are codes that I can use in the terminal to retrieve the file from the main project to R to work on it in R environment 

```bash
# 1) Make sure youâ€™re in the right project
dx env

# This is to see what is in the project - ls to see inside the project ls (folder to see inside it if there is a folder inside the folder use the next one)

dx ls -l /.Backups

# # If there are subfolders, list them too (replace with what you see)
dx ls -l "/.Backups/rstudio_cohort_r"

# The out put looks like that 
rstudio-server@a814af8c7bbe:~$ dx env

# When the file is in folder then fitch the whole folder to the R workspace ( especially if R script)

dx mkdir -p /workbook

dx download "folder name" -o /workbook/

# Example 
rstudio-server@a814af8c7bbe:~$ dx download -r "/.Backups/rstudio_cohorts.R" -o ~/workbook/

```

Now leave the terminal and go to files on the right where you can see your downloaded file 
###### most downloaded folder are in tar.gz if R script so you click on it - download it to your local computer and then go to upload - choose - select the R script and it will apper in your files - click on it in the file and it will open the script 

### For data sets ( tables CSV) its easier 

```

dx download Cohort2_data.csv

```

Then leave the terminal and go to the environment import dataset once it appears in the folder and choose import dataset and it will load to the environment
