Setting up the required Packages 
```r
pkg <- c("data.table", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "janitor", "bit64")

# Identify uninstalled packages that are required
new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]
# Install any packages from the list that are not currently installed
if (length(new.pkg)) {
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
}

# Load packages
library(data.table) # fast and efficient data handling
library(dplyr) # for data manipulation
library(ggplot2) # for data visualization
library(janitor) # data cleaning utilities
```
```
```
